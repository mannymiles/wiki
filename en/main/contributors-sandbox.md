# How to Use the Contributors Sandbox
The Contributors Sandbox folder is a place to learn and experiment, so feel free to add and update pages there. You can access the folder by clicking on the Browse button in the upper left corner (next to the Home button).

The folder is visible only to users in the Contributors group.

All users in the Contributors group have full viewing and editing priveleges in the folder, so please don't update pages created by other Contributors without their permission. And please clean up (i.e. delete) pages that you no longer need. If you want to experiment with a page already created by someone else, I suggest you create a new page using the existing page as a template (i.e. create the page using the From Template option).

Have fun!
