# How to Use the Contributors Sandbox
The Contributors Sandbox folder is a place to learn and experiment, so feel free to add and update pages there. You can access the folder by clicking on the Browse button in the upper left corner (next to the Home button).

The folder is visible to everyone, and similar to all pages on the site, everyone can make and submit changes for review through the "Edit on GitHub" button. No need to login to the Wiki site.

To gain full editing and immediate publishing of files in the sandbox, just login to the Wiki. Self-registration is enabled, so click the login button in the upper right corner (the person icon), and provide your GitHub credentials. All logged in users are automatically added as Contributors.

All users in the Contributors group have full viewing and editing priveleges in the folder, so please don't update pages created by other Contributors without their permission. And please clean up (i.e. delete) pages that you no longer need. If you want to experiment with a page already created by someone else, I suggest you create a new page using the existing page as a template (i.e. create the page using the From Template option).

Be aware that "Edit on GitHub" is currently configured to only edit Markdown files.

Have fun!
